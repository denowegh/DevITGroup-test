## Scripts

- `npm run watch`: Start the development server.
  The front end app will reload, and the back end server will restart, when you make changes.
  View the app at `http://localhost:3001`, or change the port with the `PORT` environment variable.
- `npm run build`: Build for production.
  The front end will go into the `/dist` folder, and the back end into `/built`.
- `npm start`: Start the production server. You will need to run `npm run build` first.
- `npm run lint`: Check the code for style errors.
